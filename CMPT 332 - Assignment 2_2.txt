CMPT 332 (Fall 2015)
Assignment 2 - Question 1

========================

Files edited beyond the edits made in question 1:

param.h, proc.h, proc.c, sysfile.c
  
========================
Details about what was edited in each file:

param.h:
  defined mtimes and moveup (L14-15)

proc.h:
  added priority definitions for HIGH, MED, and LOW (L4-7)
  added priority, nextproc, lastproc and t_med_run to proc
    struct (L77-80)

proc.c:
  MAJORITY OF WORK DONE HERE --> note functions and line #'s 
    before handing in!

sysfile.c:
  added head and tail pointers for high, medium and low priority
  queues to ptable structure (L23-28)

========================
What is working:
  Processes do add themselves to the correct priority lists, and are able
  to be taken from the head of the queues for execution.
  
  xv6 will run as required in the qemu emulator.

Known issues:
  When a process is forked, the new process starts running through the
  queues before exec is called. So, for example, if we do the ls command,
  sh forks. The new sh proc starts running through high, medium, and low
  queues before the sh command is turned into an ls command using exec. So,
  by the time the actual ls command starts running, it will no longer be in
  the high priority list. (Not a big problem, but if you want the new
  command to run right away, you will be waiting for a while).
