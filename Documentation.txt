==========================================================

**Files edited for this question:**
Makefile, param.h, syscall.c, syscall.h, sysfile.c, usys.S

**Files added:**
tweets.c, tweets.h, test_tweets.c

Makefile:
    changed CPUS number and added tweet.o (L 30), and test_tweets in UPROGS (L176)
    
param.h:
    added definitions of maxtweetsametag and maxtweettotal (L14-15)
    
syscall.c:
    added bput, put, bget, get, and printtweettable syscalls (L101-105, 129-133)

syscall.h:
    added bput, put, bget, get, and printtweettable syscalls (L23-27)

sysfile.c:
    added syscall implementations of bput, put, bget, get, and printtweettable
    that will call the full functions in tweet.c (L16, 445-517)

usys.S:
    added bput, put, bget, get, and printtweettable declarations (L26-30)
    
tweets.c:
    implementation of the putting/getting tweet features

test_tweets.c:
    Testing program for our tweeting syscalls

tweets.h:
    Header file for tweets.c
    
======== WHAT IS WORKING =======
Our system will enter and retrieve tweets using bget, get, put and bput as
required, using mutual exclusion. It also checks that we do not exceed the max
number of tweets. We did not get to test as many cases as we wanted to, like
some boundary cases (ran out of time).

====== THINGS TO FIX ======
The printing feature shouldn't be a syscall, and the initialization of the
tweets talbe should happen somewhere else (so we aren't locking so much). If we had more time, we would fix this.

example output (as expected):

========== Putting initial data in tweet structure ==========

========== Testing for Hash Collissions ==========

========== Forking to create multiple test threads  ==========

The tweet returned from tag tag 4      was dog 3.

The tweet returned from tag tag 4      was dog 2.

The tweet returned from tag tag 4      was dog 1.

The tweet returned from tag tag 1      was banana 3.
