========================================
Files included:

Makefile

server.c
  Runs a simple server that can have multiple local or remote sender or receiver 
  clients.Any messages sent to the server by a sender client will pass of the 
  message to any currently connected receiver clients.
  
send_client.c
  Runs a sender client that can send messages of up to 1000 characters at a time
  to the server from stdin.

recv_client.c
  Runs a receiever client to receive messages of up to 1000 characters at a time, 
  and prints them to stdout.

server.h
  Header file for the system.
  
============
What is working:
  Each receiver receives messages as sent by sender clients from time of 
  receiver connection and forward.
  
  The messages are sent correctly. A maximum message size of 1000 characters was 
  arbitarily chosen, and could easily be increased or decreased. System will give 
  friendly print out if message exceeds 1000 characters.
  
What is not working:
  The entire system works, according to assignment specs.
  

============
Test results:
Sender, receiver, and server all on different computers, one on non-local network
with many senders and receivers passed all tests. We tested both short and maximum length
messages. We also tested empty messages, special characters, and messages that were too
long. 

We tested receivers and senders joining and leaving the network at different intervals, 
and the program behaves as expected. 

'quit' works to exit the sender, but there is no graceful exit for receiver or server,
due to the fact that they are only listeners and take no stdin input.
