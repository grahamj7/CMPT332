========================

Files edited:

proc.h, proc.c, sysfile.c, syscall.c, syscall.h, user.h, usys.S, Makefile, trap.c, test1.c
  
========================
Details about what was edited in each file:

proc.h:
  added created, ended, running variables to struct proc in proc.h (L69-71)

proc.c:
  added initialization of created, ended, running variables of the
    proc structure in allocproc() function (code at L73-78)
  added the setting of the ended variable within the proc stucture
    within the exit() function (code at L 201-204)
    
sysfile.c:
  added ptable struct  so that we could use it in our waitstat function
    below (L17-22)
  added sys_waitstat(void) function (L451-495) <---*MAIN CODE FOR THIS QUESTION*
    
syscall.c:
  added waitstat to syscall listings (L101 and L125)

syscall.h:
  added waitstat as syscall 22 (L23)
  
user.h:
  added waitlist(int*, int*) to list of declarations (L26)

usys.S:
  added waitstat syscall (L32)

Makefile:
  added _test1/ in UPROGS (L175)
  
trap.c:
  added p->running incrementer in trap function(L58-60)

test1.c:
  brand new file written to test waitstat syscall. <---*MAIN CODE FOR THIS QUESTION*
